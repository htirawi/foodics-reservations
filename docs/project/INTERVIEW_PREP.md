# üé§ Interview Preparation Guide

**Purpose**: Comprehensive guide to help you confidently answer any technical questions about the Foodics Reservations project during job interviews.

---

## üéØ **Project Overview (30-Second Pitch)**

> "I built a Vue 3 + TypeScript restaurant reservation management system for Foodics. It features a feature-first architecture with tiny components, pure utility functions, comprehensive testing (454+ unit tests), and full i18n/RTL support. The system handles branch management, reservation settings, and time slot configuration with strict type safety and accessibility compliance."

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Deep Dive**

### **"Explain the architecture"**

**Answer**: "We use a feature-first architecture where each feature (like branches) contains its own components, composables, stores, and services. Global components and composables are shared across features. This provides clear separation of concerns and makes the codebase scalable."

**Key Points**:
- **Feature-first structure**: `src/features/branches/` contains all branch-related code
- **Separation of concerns**: Components (UI), Composables (logic), Stores (state), Services (API)
- **Global vs Feature-scoped**: Shared utilities vs feature-specific implementations
- **Data flow**: Component ‚Üí Composable ‚Üí Store ‚Üí Service ‚Üí API

### **"How do you handle state management?"**

**Answer**: "We use Pinia for state management with a combination of global stores (like UI state) and feature stores (like branches state). Composables handle local component state, and we use stores for complex state that needs to be shared."

**Key Points**:
- **Pinia stores**: `useBranchesStore()` for feature state, `useUIStore()` for global UI
- **Optimistic updates**: UI updates immediately, rolls back on API failure
- **Composables**: Handle local component state and reusable logic
- **Type safety**: All state fully typed with strict TypeScript

### **"How do you ensure type safety?"**

**Answer**: "We use strict TypeScript configuration with no `any` or `unknown` types. All shared types are defined in `/types` folder with I-prefixed interfaces, and we use generic types for reusable interfaces. This catches errors at compile time."

**Key Points**:
- **Strict TypeScript**: `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`
- **I-prefixed interfaces**: `IUser`, `IApiError`, `IBranch` for consistency
- **Generic types**: `SelectionState<T>`, `FoodicsResponse<T>` for reusability
- **Type imports**: `import type { ... }` for compile-time optimization

---

## üß© **Component Architecture**

### **"How do you keep components maintainable?"**

**Answer**: "We enforce strict size limits - components must be under 150 lines with complexity under 8. Complex logic is extracted to composables or pure utility functions. Components only handle props/emits, simple state, and template structure."

**Key Points**:
- **Size limits**: SFC ‚â§150 lines, script ‚â§120 lines, complexity ‚â§8
- **Pure utils**: Extract complex logic to `src/utils/` (time parsing, slot validation)
- **Composables**: Reusable logic with Vue APIs (`ref`, `computed`)
- **Single responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose

### **"How do you handle complex forms?"**

**Answer**: "We break complex forms into smaller components and use composables for form logic. For example, the reservation settings form uses `useSettingsValidation` composable and pure utility functions for time slot validation."

**Key Points**:
- **Form composables**: `useSettingsValidation`, `useDaySlotsEditor`
- **Pure validation**: `src/utils/slots.ts` for slot validation logic
- **i18n integration**: Error keys returned by utils, translated by UI
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Utility Functions & Pure Logic**

### **"How do you handle complex business logic?"**

**Answer**: "We extract complex logic to pure utility functions. For example, time slot validation is handled by pure functions in `src/utils/slots.ts` that return i18n error keys. This keeps components tiny and makes the logic testable and reusable."

**Key Points**:
- **Pure functions**: No side effects, no DOM, no external dependencies
- **Time utilities**: `parseTime`, `formatTime`, `toMinutes` without Date libraries
- **Slot validation**: `canAddSlot`, `isOverlapping`, `normalizeDay`
- **i18n-ready**: Return error keys for UI translation

### **"How do you test utility functions?"**

**Answer**: "We have comprehensive unit tests for all utils (454+ tests). The functions are pure with no side effects, making them easy to test in isolation. We also have E2E smoke tests that verify error keys are properly translated in the UI."

**Key Points**:
- **Unit tests**: Vitest for pure function testing
- **E2E tests**: Playwright for UI integration
- **Test coverage**: 454+ unit tests, comprehensive edge case coverage
- **Offline testing**: All tests run offline with mocked API calls

---

## üåê **API & Service Layer**

### **"How do you handle API calls?"**

**Answer**: "We have a centralized HTTP client with interceptors for authentication and error handling. Feature-specific services handle API calls, and we use composables to manage loading states and error handling in components."

**Key Points**:
- **Centralized HTTP**: Axios instance with base URL and interceptors
- **Service layer**: `BranchesService` for feature-specific API calls
- **Error normalization**: Consistent `ApiError` format
- **Type safety**: All API responses fully typed

### **"How do you handle errors?"**

**Answer**: "We normalize all API errors to a consistent format and use optimistic updates with rollback. Error messages are handled through i18n for user-friendly display, and we have comprehensive error boundaries."

**Key Points**:
- **Error normalization**: `IApiError` interface with status, message, details
- **Optimistic updates**: UI updates immediately, rolls back on failure
- **i18n errors**: User-friendly error messages in EN/AR
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout the app

---

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **"How do you test your application?"**

**Answer**: "We use Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for E2E tests. Unit tests focus on composables and stores, while E2E tests cover user flows. All tests run offline with mocked API calls to ensure reliability."

**Key Points**:
- **Unit tests**: Vitest for composables, stores, and utils
- **E2E tests**: Playwright for user flows and integration
- **Offline testing**: No real API calls, all requests mocked
- **Test coverage**: 454+ unit tests, comprehensive E2E coverage

### **"How do you ensure test reliability?"**

**Answer**: "We use `data-testid` attributes for stable selectors, mock all API calls, and run tests offline. We also have safety preflight checks to prevent accidental real API calls during testing."

**Key Points**:
- **Stable selectors**: `data-testid` instead of brittle CSS selectors
- **API mocking**: All requests intercepted and fulfilled with fixtures
- **Safety checks**: Preflight validation to prevent real API calls
- **Offline mode**: Tests run without network dependencies

---

## üåç **Internationalization & Accessibility**

### **"How do you handle multiple languages?"**

**Answer**: "We use vue-i18n with EN/AR support and RTL layout. All user-facing strings go through i18n, and we use logical CSS properties for RTL support. Error messages from utils return i18n keys for translation."

**Key Points**:
- **vue-i18n**: EN/AR locale support with RTL layout
- **Logical properties**: `ms-*`, `me-*` instead of `ml-*`, `mr-*`
- **i18n-ready utils**: Return error keys, not hardcoded messages
- **RTL testing**: E2E tests run in both EN and AR modes

### **"How do you ensure accessibility?"**

**Answer**: "We follow WCAG guidelines with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML. All interactive elements are keyboard accessible, and we have visible focus indicators. We also test with screen readers."

**Key Points**:
- **ARIA labels**: Proper `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`
- **Keyboard navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **Focus management**: Visible focus indicators and proper tab order
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmarks

## üöÄ **Performance & Optimization**

### **"How do you optimize performance?"**

**Answer**: "We use Vue 3's Composition API for better tree-shaking, keep components tiny to reduce bundle size, and use pure utility functions to avoid unnecessary re-renders. We also have strict TypeScript for compile-time optimizations."

**Key Points**:
- **Tiny components**: Under 150 lines reduces bundle size
- **Pure functions**: Utils don't cause re-renders
- **Tree-shaking**: Composition API enables better dead code elimination
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time optimizations and error catching

### **"How do you handle bundle size?"**

**Answer**: "We use minimal dependencies - no UI kits or heavy libraries. We rely on Tailwind for styling and pure TypeScript for utilities. The bundle is optimized through tree-shaking and careful dependency management."

**Key Points**:
- **Minimal deps**: Only essential libraries (Vue, Pinia, Axios, Tailwind)
- **No UI kits**: Custom components built with Tailwind
- **Pure utils**: No external dependencies in utility functions
- **Tree-shaking**: Composition API enables better dead code elimination

## üîß **Development Workflow**

### **"How do you maintain code quality?"**

**Answer**: "We have strict ESLint rules, comprehensive TypeScript configuration, and automated testing. We enforce component size limits and complexity rules. All code must pass lint, typecheck, and tests before merging."

**Key Points**:
- **Strict ESLint**: No `eslint-disable`, complexity limits, naming conventions
- **TypeScript strict**: No `any`/`unknown`, exact optional properties
- **Size limits**: Components under 150 lines, complexity under 8
- **Quality gates**: Lint, typecheck, unit tests, E2E tests

### **"How do you handle code reviews?"**

**Answer**: "We use conventional commits, require all quality gates to pass, and have comprehensive PR templates. We focus on architecture decisions, type safety, and test coverage in reviews."

**Key Points**:
- **Conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` prefixes
- **Quality gates**: All tests must pass before merge
- **PR templates**: Structured review process with checklists
- **Architecture focus**: Reviews focus on patterns and maintainability
