## 🔍 **Key Concepts to Master**

### **1. Feature-First Architecture**
```
src/
  features/
    branches/           # 🎯 Branches feature
      components/       # Feature-specific UI
      composables/      # Feature-specific logic
      stores/           # Feature-specific state
      services/         # Feature-specific API
  components/           # 🌍 Global components
  composables/          # 🌍 Global composables
  services/             # 🌍 Cross-feature services
```

### **2. Component Hierarchy**
- **Global Components**: Reusable across features (BaseButton, BaseModal)
- **Layout Components**: Structure the app (AppHeader, Toaster)
- **Feature Components**: Specific to one feature (BranchesTable, AddBranchesModal)

### **3. Composable Patterns**
- **Global Composables**: Reusable logic (useAsyncAction, useToast)
- **Feature Composables**: Feature-specific logic (useBranchSelection)
- **State Management**: Pinia stores for complex state

### **4. Service Layer**
- **HTTP Client**: Centralized Axios with interceptors
- **API Services**: Feature-specific API calls
- **Error Handling**: Normalized error format

### **5. Type Safety**
- **Strict TypeScript**: No `any` or `unknown`
- **Generic Types**: Reusable type definitions
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces

- Understand how the patterns are implemented
- See real examples in the codebase

### **2. Use the Browser Dev Tools**
- Inspect components in action
- See how props and state flow
- Understand the component lifecycle

### **3. Run the Tests**
- Tests show expected behavior
- Understand how components should work
- See integration patterns

### **4. Experiment with Components**
- Try modifying components to learn
- Create simple test components
- Understand the patterns by doing

### **5. Follow the Data Flow**
- Start from user interaction
- Follow data through components, composables, stores, services
- Understand how state changes propagate

## 🎯 **Common Interview Questions & Answers**

### **"Explain the architecture"**
> "We use a feature-first architecture where each feature (like branches) contains its own components, composables, stores, and services. Global components and composables are shared across features. This provides clear separation of concerns and makes the codebase scalable."

### **"How do you handle state management?"**
> "We use Pinia for state management with a combination of global stores (like UI state) and feature stores (like branches state). Composables handle local component state, and we use stores for complex state that needs to be shared."

### **"How do you ensure type safety?"**
> "We use strict TypeScript configuration with no `any` or `unknown` types. All shared types are defined in `/types` folder, and we use generic types for reusable interfaces. This catches errors at compile time."

### **"How do you handle API calls?"**
> "We have a centralized HTTP client with interceptors for authentication and error handling. Feature-specific services handle API calls, and we use composables to manage loading states and error handling in components."

### **"How do you test your code?"**
> "We use Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for E2E tests. Unit tests focus on composables and stores, while E2E tests cover user flows. All tests run offline with mocked API calls."
